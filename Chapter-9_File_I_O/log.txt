Directory Creation: Added a line to ensure the tables directory exists using os.makedirs().
File Naming: Changed the file name inside the open function to use the correct value of n for each table (table_{n}.txt).
Function Call: Moved the function call python to generate tables from 2 to 20 outside of the genMul() function to avoid infinite recursion.
How it works: Python generated
It generates a multiplication table for each number from 2 to 20.
Each table is saved in a separate file inside the tables/ directory.
